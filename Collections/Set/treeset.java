TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree for storage.
 The ordering of the elements is maintained by a set using their natural ordering whether or not an explicit
 comparator is provided. This must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the Set interface.
